# Getting Started with IT Services

This project was bootstrapped with `ReactJs`, `Tailwind component CSS`, `React router DOM`, `Context API`. And for, server handling I have used `Express Js`, for storing data in database `mongoDB` is used, and later hosted the API in `Vercel` server and finally hosted tha app in firebase successfully. Moreoverly,

1. ** I have included Firbase Google Auth Provider, Github Auth Provider as Authentication services for user login along with general Sign in.**
2. ** To store data I have used mongoDB Cluster**
3. ** Private Routes prevent access through some routes, and access is only permitted after authentication.**
4. ** All of the data are dynamically displayed and collected from the API using Id in the services route. **
5. ** To scroll within the same page I have used react-scroll.**
6. ** User will get error if the login information doesn't match with authentication provider. **
7. ** An errorelement page is added that will handle unnecessay url link issue. **
8. ** User will get error if the login information doesn't match with authentication provider. **
9. ** Using Context API to send data to the children components without props, made this app more robust. **
10. ** User will only be able to give feedback if he/she is authentic user, either they will redirected to login page.**
12. ** I have used react-to-photo npm package to view the image in card zoomed in.**
